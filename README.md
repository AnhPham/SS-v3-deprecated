<b>RELEASE NOTES:</b>

Version 3.0.0

- I'm very glad to announce that the 3rd version of SS-System was released! With this new system, you can use both NGUI or uGUI - the new UI System of Unity. Besides, I made new demo for you can learn it much faster, both nGUI & uGUI Demo. And the last, now you can use Navigation Mesh with my system. Try it!

I . How to use Demo:

1. Add all scenes in SSSystem/Demos/Scenes/uGUI to Build Setting.
2. Play this scene: SSSystem/Demos/Scenes/uGUI/DemoSceneManager
3. If you want to play nGUI demo, import the newest NGUI version, then do again step 1 & 2, but using the paths ../nGUI/.. instead of ../uGUI/..
